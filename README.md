# About

The goal was to experiment with new technologies and play with Redux in practice. My applications were in need of more organized state management, so I discovered Redux.

This application was a great opportunity to test numerous new technologies:

* Styled Components -> Stitches
* Font Awesome -> Phosphor Icons.
* create-react-app -> Vite
